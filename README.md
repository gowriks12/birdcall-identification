# Birdcall-Identification

This project aims at identifying birds based on their bird calls. The tasks carried out to complete the project include converting the audio data to its corresponding Mel spectrograms using the librosa python library for audio signal processing. The spectrograms are then stored for further classification using Convolutional Neural Networks of different stages. A web application for the birdcall identification was also developed to make it interactive using React JS.
